    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>
      Aspiring Front End Developer from Gothenburg, Sweden - Currently studying
      my second year at Medieinstitutet. My previous experience involves data
      coordination, design, service and quite a bit of marketing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always on the hunt to expand my knowledge, and there isn't much I'm not
      curious about. Apart from diving into all things development, I often play
      around with tools like photoshop and blender. I see myself as a creative
      person, and my dream job would be to work at the intersection between
      design and front end.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my spare time my interests revolves around art, music, hiking &
      training my dog (and yes, she's adorable).
